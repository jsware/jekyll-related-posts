This is a random set of related posts.

**NB: Related posts are chosen randomly at site build time (Jekyll is a static site generator after all). Related posts do not change when this post is accessed, only when the site is built.**

Random pages are chosen from `site.posts` so include `_posts` **but not** other collections.
