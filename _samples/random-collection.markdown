This is a random set of pages from the same collection.

**NB: Related posts are chosen randomly at site build time (Jekyll is a static site generator after all). Related posts do not change when this page is accessed, only when the site is built.**

Here, random pages are chosen from the current collection, so **do not** include posts or other collections.
